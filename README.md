# Tweets-by-Democrats-and-Republicans
A data exploration project for different senators who are either republican or democrat. We then try to analyse the tendencies based on key terms.
We go on to pull out all the hashtags(#) and mentions(@) they used to dissect the overall attitude of the senators. 
This was a project on how powerful coding is. With few line of code I could bring out all the tweets done by a specific republican senator reffering to the word masks.
And in the write up for this project we discussed how the misusage of such powerful tools could be a net negative if not used wisely.
